                <h3>Brief Timeline of Nikola Tesla's life</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1859 - The birth of an unparallelled genius, Nikola Tesla</li>
                    <li>1863 - Tesla's brother died from a horse riding accident</li>
                    <li>1870 - Tesla moved to Karlovac where he learned about Math and Physics from his teacher which had a decisive influence on him.</li>
                    <li>1873 - Tesla contracted cholera and was hospitalized for 9 months</li>
                    <li>1875 - Tesla attended college on a Military Scholarship. He lost his scholarship at the end of his second year, stopped attending lectures near the end of his third year, and eventually dropped out on the following year.</li>
                    <li>1880 - Tesla arrived in Prague and studied Philosophy, though he did not receive marks for the courses</li>
                    <li>1881 - Tesla worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office in Budapest. A few months later, he worked as Chief Electrician in the Budapest Telephone Exchange.</li>
                    <li>1882 - Tesla accepted a position in the Continental Edison Company. He later on submitted a plan for improving the Edison dynamos but he was dispatched to Strasbourg before payment was awarded.</li>
                    <li>1885 - Tesla quits Edison's company when Edison reneges on his promise to pay Tesla $50,000 if Tesla can improve the Edison Dynamo, which Tesla does far exceeding Edison's expectations. He later starts the Tesla Electric Light company with the backing of investors. After he completed the work, he was forced out of the company with only worthless stocks because the investors founded a different company.</li>
                    <li>1887 - Tesla comes up with an induction motor operated by alternating current. It had a basic self-starting design that did not need commutators which reduced the maintenance costs associated with replacing mechanical brushes.</li>
                    <li>1890 - Tesla develops some of the first neon lighting, fluorescent illuminaton, and takes the first X-Ray photographs. His greatest discovery however, was when he illuminated a vacuum tube wirelessly by transmitting energy through the air. This consequently began his lifelong obssession of wirelessly transmitting energy.</li>
                    <li>1888 - Tesla reads his paper titled "A New System of Alternating-Current Motors and Transformers" before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (now IEEE). A few months later, he sells AC Polyphase System Patents to George Westinghouse for a large amount including royalties per horsepower for each motor.</li>
                    <li>1891 - H.P. Brown, manufacturer of electric chairs, and an ally to Edison, began electrocuting animals using AC as a part of an Edison-sponsored smear campaign against Westinghouse. Westinghouse suffered huge losses and asked Tesla to lower or temporarily rescind his royalties. Tesla's response was to tear up their original contract on the spot and relinquished his royalties, because he was very grateful to Westinghouse for believing in him. His royalties are now equal to more than $300 million in today's dollars. If he still had the contract, it would generate over a billion dollars in royalties per year for his relatives.</li>
                    <li>1943 - Tragic death of Nikola Tesla in a hotel room in New York. He held over 300 Patents for his inventions</li>
                </ul>
